# Fonts

## Nerd Fonts

The Nerd Fonts I use can be downloaded from here:

- [Nerfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
- [Github](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases).

I usually swap between JetBrainsMono, Hack, MesloLGM and GeistMono.

## Consolas ligaturized

One of my favorites, unfortunately it does not work well with my setup of Neovim. Maybe I can patch it (info [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts?tab=readme-ov-file#font-patcher)). The font is available here:
